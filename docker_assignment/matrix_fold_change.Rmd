First, I initialize the 5x10 matrix with the following code
```{r}
x <- matrix(data = sample(1:100, 50), nrow = 5, ncol = 10)
colnames(x) = c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3", "cond4", "cond5",
                "ctrl1", "ctrl2", "ctrl3", "ctrl4", "ctrl5")
rownames(x) = c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")
```

Then, I got the average expression levels for each gene in the 
control/conditional settings:
```{r}
cond_means <- rowMeans(x[,1:5])
ctrl_means <- rowMeans(x[,6:10])
```
Finally, I calculated the fold change and outputted it as a data frame:
```{r}
fold_changes <- cond_means / ctrl_means
fold_change_df <- data.frame("Gene" = paste0("gene", 1:5), "FC" = fold_changes)
fold_change_df
```
